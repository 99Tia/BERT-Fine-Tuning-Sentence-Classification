# Fine-Tuning and Deploying BERT for Grammatical Acceptability Classification with Interactive Prediction Interface

This project involves fine-tuning a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to classify sentences as grammatically correct or incorrect. 


## Dataset

 - I have used the [Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)](https://nyu-mll.github.io/CoLA/) dataset for this project.
